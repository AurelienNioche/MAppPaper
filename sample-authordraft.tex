Motivation is often a major obstacle to adherence to an exercise plan.
For instance, poor adherence to rehabilitation programs has been observed,
despite the importance they can have, notably in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions.
In this work, we explore how nudging through personalized incentives
(small monetary rewards spread over the day)
can improve adherence to a daily exercise goal in participants.
For personalizing the incentives, we are using the active inference
framework that allows us to deal with the trade-off between learning
about how the policy concerning the incentives
affects the participant's behavior and helping them meet their objective.

\section{Introduction}

Adherence to an exercise plan is crucial for maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases. However,
motivation is often a major obstacle to adherence, even in the context of rehabilitation programs where the stakes
are high \cite{daly2002barriers}. In this work, we explore how such personalized nudging, which is the use of behavioral insights to design interventions that are tailored to an individualâ€™s specific needs and preferences, can improve adherence to a daily exercise goal in participants.

To personalize the incentives (i.e. nudging), we use the active inference framework, which allows us to
balance
learning about how the policy concerning the incentives affects the participantâ€™s behavior and helping them meet
their objective. Active inference is a mathematical framework that originated in computational neuroscience as a
theory of how the brain implements action, perception, and learning. It has recently been shown to be a promising
approach to the problems of state-estimation and control under uncertainty, as well as a foundation for the
construction of goal-driven behaviors in robotics and artificial agents in general. In this work, we would like to
show that it is also a promising approach to the problem of designing personalized nudging interventions.

After presenting the related works, we first give a vision of the computational problem at stake, and then
provide a concrete case of application where we personalize nudging through smallã€€monetaryã€€incentivesã€€spread over the day to improveã€€adherence to a daily step goal in healthy participants.


\section{Related Work}

There is a growing body of research on the use of personalized nudging to promote healthy behaviors, including exercise.
Personalized nudging refers to the use of behavioral insights to design interventions that are tailored to an individualâ€™s
specific needs and preferences\cite{mills_2022}. This approach has been shown to be effective in promoting a variety
of healthy behaviors, including physical activity\cite{forberger2019nudging}.

One study found that personalized nudging can be used to promote physical activity among older
adults\cite{room2017interventions}. The study used a two-component framework for personalization, which involved
personalizing both the choices being nudged towards (choice personalization) and the method of nudging itself
(delivery personalization). The results showed that personalized nudging was effective in increasing physical activity levels among older adults.

Another study investigated the use of choice architecture techniques to promote physical activity at the population
level \cite{forberger2019nudging}. The study found that while nudging interventions were commonly used to promote
physical activity, most interventions were implemented at the individual level. The authors suggest that there is a need for more research on the use of nudging interventions at the population level.

In addition to personalized nudging, there are other approaches that have been used to promote physical activity. A
pilot program in the UK is exploring the use of financial incentives, such as vouchers and discounts, to encourage
adults to make healthier choices, including increasing physical activity \cite{govuk2021}.
A systematic review found that social support, particularly from family members, is positively associated with
physical activity levels in older adults \cite{lindsay2017association}. Another study found that social support can enable physical activity
uptake and maintenance through encouragement, resources, and companionship \cite{smith2023relationship}.

In the context of improving adherence to an exercise plan, personalized nudging using active inference could be a promising approach. Active inference is a framework for understanding decision-making and behavior that has been applied in various domains. By incorporating individual differences and personalizing the nudges, it may be possible to improve adherence to an exercise plan.

Active inference is based on the free energy principle, which suggests that the brain reduces surprise or uncertainty
 by making predictions based on internal models and updating them using sensory input \cite{mann2022free}. This
 principle integrates  Bayesian inference with active inference, where actions are guided by predictions and sensory feedback refines them.
  It has wide-ranging implications for comprehending brain function, perception, and action
  \cite{bruineberg2018anticipating}. Although Active inference is a mathematical framework that originated in
  computational neuroscience, it has recently been shown to be a promising approach to the problems of
  state-estimation and control under uncertainty, as well as a foundation for the construction of goal-driven
  behaviors in robotics and artificial agents in general\cite{lanillos2021active}. In particular, active inference
  has been used to augment traditional reinforcement learning approaches by furnishing an inherent balance of
  exploration and exploitation, and providing a more flexible conceptualization of
  reward\cite{tschantz2020reinforcement}. Active inference has also been applied to social robotics, where it has
  been shown to have potential in terms of adaptation, generalization, and robustness\cite{da2022active}.

In summary, personalized nudging using active inference could be a powerful tool for improving adherence to an exercise plan. By taking into account individual differences and personalizing the nudges, it may be possible to achieve better outcomes than with traditional nudging approaches.
